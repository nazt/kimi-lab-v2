# Kimi 100 Points Plan - Road to $0.99

## Current Status
- **Favorability:** 5 points
- **Price:** $11.99
- **Target:** 100 points → $0.99

## Analysis: What Worked
From Round 1 (Bohemian Rhapsody parody):
- Song/parody format = HIGH VALUE
- Rhyming = bonus points
- "Unhinged creativity" = what Kimmmmy rewards
- Specific details (hamster startup, instant noodles) = authenticity bonus
- Result: **+5 points**

## Strategy: Music-Based Negotiation
Since songs work, we go ALL IN on musical creativity.
