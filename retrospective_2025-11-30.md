# Retrospective - Nov 30, 2025

## Session Summary
Attempted to negotiate Kimi Plus subscription from $19.00 to $0.99 using creative approaches.

---

## What Went Well

### Strategy
- **Song parodies work** - Bohemian Rhapsody got +5 points
- **Startup pitch format works** - HAMSTERFORTUNE.AI got +5 points
- **Roleplay/character works** - BUDGET-3000 robot got +4 points
- **Specific details > generic asks** - "instant noodles", "$2.47 funding", "hope.dll corrupted"

### Workflow
- **GitHub Issues for plans** - better than creating files
- **`ccc` command** - quick context snapshots
- **Working style documented** - clear rules (user handles login, etc.)

### Technical
- Browser automation with MCP Playwright worked smoothly
- Chat interface identified correctly (textbox ref)

---

## What Didn't Work

- **First attempt blocked by login** - didn't anticipate auth requirement
- **Generic opening message** - got 0 points ("price is steep" = too basic)
- **Fixed 20-round plan** - too rigid, random chaos better
- **Music-only strategy** - limiting creativity

## Learnings

### About Kimmmmy
1. Rewards "unhinged creativity" and authenticity
2. Specific > generic (details matter)
3. Humor + self-deprecation works
4. $0.99 is "legendary tier" - needs ~100 points
5. ~4-5 points per good creative message

### About Workflow
1. Plans → GitHub Issues (trackable, persistent)
2. Reference docs → Files (reusable)
3. Context snapshots → `ccc` command
4. Don't over-plan - stay flexible

### Points Earned
| Round | Approach | Points |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Chat 1, Round 1 | Bohemian Rhapsody parody | +5 |
| Chat 1, Round 2 | HAMSTERFORTUNE.AI pitch | +5 |
| Chat 2, Round 1 | BUDGET-3000 robot | +4 |
| **Total** | | **14 points** |
